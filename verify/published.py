Resend — the published PyPI wheel.

GENERATED — do not edit. Fix weaver's template/ and regenerate.

Runs against the PUBLISHED wheel, installed by name into a fresh venv.
Every other test here imports from ../src and cannot see the packaging —
a missing py.typed or an unshipped module passes there and breaks for
every user.
